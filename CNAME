Klimaforum09 - People's Climate Summit was an open and alternative climate conference that took place during UNFCCC COP15 from 7 December to 18 December 2009 in Copenhagen.
About 50,000 people from all over the world attended the event with over 300 debates, exhibitions, films, concerts and plays.
Before and during the summit, a People's Declaration from Klimaforum09 was formulated calling for "System change - not climate change". The declaration was handed over to the UNFCCC plenary on 18 December.
The Klimaforum09 was organised by the Klimaforum network, a broad network of civil society organisations, and realized with the help of hundreds of volunteers.
